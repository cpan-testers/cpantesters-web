<h2>Site News</h2>
<p>CPAN Testers is currently as stable as it has ever been, though some historic features are still missing. We are running on a K3s Kubernetes cluster now, with hosting and storage provided by <a href="https://netactuate.com">NetActuate</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to help, join us on IRC in the #cpantesters-discuss channel on <a href="https://www.irc.perl.org">irc.perl.org</a>, start a discussion on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/cpan-testers/discussions">visit the discussions on GitHub</a>, <a href="https://lists.perl.org/list/cpan-testers-discuss.html">join the mailing list</a>, or <a href="mailto:admin@cpantesters.org">e-mail admin@cpantesters.org directly</a>.</p>

<p>The features we are still missing are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some pages on this site are still mockups. Instead, use <a href="https://matrix.cpantesters.org">the CPAN Testers Matrix</a> or <a href="https://magpie.cpantesters.org">CPAN Testers Magpie</a> to see aggregations of test report data.</li>
  <li>We still do not send out e-mail notifications of reports. We could use some help on this one.</li>
</ul>
